# Instructions on using the Docker script

To create the docker container run (Make sure you are in the directory that contains the script):
```bash 
    bash build.sh
```

If the test provided test fails, run the build script again 

To remove the docker container run:
```bash 
    bash clean.sh
```

That's all!
Be warned that I have not tested it on Windows!
